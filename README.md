👋 Hello! I'm Mahdi Mtibaa, a recent graduate with a degree in engineering from IIT Sfax, Tunisia. I'm an enthusiastic developer with a passion for creating web and mobile applications.

💻 On the front-end, I specialize in React, utilizing its power to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. I'm also proficient in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, allowing me to design visually appealing websites. With knowledge of EJS, I can work with server-side rendering in Node.js and Express.js. Furthermore, I have experience with Flutter, a versatile framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

🌐 Back-end development is where I thrive, and I'm particularly enthusiastic about working with Node.js and Express.js. With Node.js, I can build efficient and scalable server-side applications, while Express.js provides me with a minimalistic and flexible framework for creating APIs and web applications. Additionally, I'm exploring Spring Boot, which enables me to build scalable Java-based applications. I also have experience working with Laravel, a popular PHP framework known for its simplicity and ease of use.

🗄️ When it comes to databases, I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL solutions. I've worked with MariaDB and PostgreSQL for SQL databases, leveraging their relational capabilities for structured data. Additionally, I'm proficient in MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility in handling unstructured and rapidly changing data.

🌟 As a junior developer, I'm constantly eager to learn and grow. I'm dedicated to writing clean and maintainable code while following industry best practices. I value teamwork and collaboration, and I'm always open to learning from experienced professionals.
